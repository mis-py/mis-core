# New

- Added pipeline for tests and vulnerabilities check. pylint, pytest, bandit and docker scout used.
- Added WIP pipeline for image build and push to public registry.

# Core improvements and changes
- Env variables moved out from project. Now it is only configurable by set it in docker or any other way.
- Extended README.md description with nearly all possible env variables.
- Updated Dockerfile, switched base image to python:3.12-alpine
- POSTGRES_CREATE_DB env replaced with argument in tortoise_manager.py.
- Tried to fix yoyo connections bug, no luck
- lifespan was changed to support test methods. DB Migrations temporarily replaced with direct scheme generation
- Updated package versions for fastapi, tortoise-orm and some more
- pytest.ini options moved to pyproject.toml
- tests moved to fully async workflow except for unittests

# Bugs
- yoyo migrations in test pipeline not work due to db connections not properly closed. still investigating.
- unittests broken after async intoruced
- log files creation in CI pipeline broken by runner permissions
